					<h2>consol3 <a href="http://derekrliang.github.io/consol3/">[demo]</a><a href="https://github.com/derekrliang/consol3">[repo]</a></h2>
					<p>A HTML5 CSS3 website taking on the antique style of a DOS Command Line, enhanced with JQuery for command processing and dynamic DOM manipulation. Mainly used for testing JQuery boundaries.</p>

					<h2>derekrliang.github.io <a href="http://derekrliang.github.io/">[demo]</a><a href="https://github.com/derekrliang/derekrliang.github.io">[repo]</a></h2>
					<p>My personal about me website, developed from scratch. In fact, the website you see right here, is actually this. It is built using just HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Hosted on GitHub Pages.</p>
					<h2>MacroCalc <a href="https://github.com/derekrliang/MacroCalc">[repo]</a></h2>
					<p>Amazed at the importance of nutrition in fitness training, I developed a macro-nutrient calculator made in Java Swing that calculates protein, carbohydrate, and fat based on individual weight and maintenance calorie intake. Based on the individual's goal: whether to lose weight or gain weight, the calculator will adjust their suggested target calorie intake in order to reach their goal.</p>

					<h2>Sleep Maze <a href="http://challengepost.com/software/sleep-maze">[challengepost]</a></h2>
					<p>Working with a group of four people for HackUCI 2014, we built a top-down 2D maze game. As a sleep-deprived person, the player's objective is to find the bed, so the player can go to sleep. Working as the lead developer, since I had the most experience on the team with Unity and C#.</p>
					<h2>Grammar Brushstrokes <a href="https://github.com/derekrliang/inf117-w14-teamb">[repo]</a></h2>
					<p>Working with a group of seven for INF 117: Project in Software Engineering, Winter 2014. We built a peer-to-peer grammar feedback application on Ruby on Rails. The goal of the web app is to improve student grammar in elementary school through constant usage. Our client was Professor Rebecca W. Black from UC Irvine School of Education.</p>
					<h2>Project X <a href="https://github.com/derekrliang/ProjectX">[repo]</a><a href="http://derekrliang.github.io/ProjectX/">[site]</a></h2>
					<p>Working with a group of five for CS 113: Computer Game Development, Winter 2014. We built a 2D platform side-sliding game in Unity using C#. I worked as the lead developer. In order to beat the game, the player has to reach the end of the main level, fighting enemies, and defeat the boss.</p>

					<h2>ZotPark</h2>
					<p>With a team of five, we got 2nd place at UC Irvine Fall AppJam 2011. We designed an Android mobile application that helps students navigate the UC Irvine parking lot system. ZotPark allows users to look up valid locations to park based on their permit type. ZotPark can also determine and display extra parking lots and structures available to the user, depending on time of day. Additionally, the app provides information about parking lots and permit types, as well as navigation capabilities. "When I was new to campus, I spent 20 minutes driving up and down Peltason looking for Lot 17A and no one could help me find it," said Clark. "But this app can."</p>
